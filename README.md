# AngularJS vs jQuery

POC showing to jQuery fans that AngularJS can do the same job.

## Overview 

For a long time people told to me that the good job of jQuery is that anyone without Javascript knowledge can create a layout and then, later, give it life without explicit directives.

Here I present five scenarios in which jQuery and AngularJS are able to create the same behaviour from layouts without any AngularJS directive.

It is also a very good starting point for those jQuery experts who want to start understanding the AngularJS way.

## How to use

Clone this repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/drpicox/angularjs-vs-jquery.git
```

Serve it:

```bash
$ cd angularjs-vs-jquery
$ http-server .
```

And open it with the browser.

## Examples

Available examples are:

- bind.html: shows how to bind values

- event.html: shows how to deal with browser events

- index.html: index of available options

- template.html: how to use inlined templates in AngularJS (not possible in jQuery unless libraries like underscore or angular)

- update.html: how to handle events and update values in the screen
